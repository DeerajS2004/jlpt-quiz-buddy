# 🗾 JLPT Practice

A calm, sidebar-driven JLPT (N5–N1) mock-test app with the hush and precision of a Japanese stationery shop. Built with **TanStack Start + React 19 + Tailwind v4**, and packaged as a cross-platform desktop app with **Electron**.

> Paper & Hanko palette · Modern Sans typography (Space Grotesk / DM Sans) · Sidebar layout

## Features

- **Daily mock tests** — load any JSON question set, sit a timed session
- **5 categories** — Kanji (漢字), Vocabulary (語彙), Grammar (文法), Reading (読解), Expression (表現)
- **Configurable timer** — simulate real exam pressure (or turn it off)
- **No-spoiler quiz flow** — answers stay hidden until the end
- **Tabbed review** — Wrong / Correct / All on the results screen, defaulting to Wrong
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — `1–4` to pick an option, `← / →` to navigate, `Enter` to confirm
- **Lifetime statistics** — accuracy, streaks, per-category progress bars, session history
- **Local-only, persistent** — all progress is stored via `localStorage` in Electron's per-user data directory. History and stats stay put across app restarts and updates. No accounts, no cloud.

## Question file format

Drop a JSON file like this into **Load Test** (or pick the bundled **JLPT N5 Kanji** set):

```json
{
  "title": "JLPT N5 Kanji — Complete Set",
  "description": "Optional description",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "type": "kanji",
      "question": "「一」の意味は何ですか？",
      "reading": "いち / ひと",
      "options": ["One", "Two", "Three", "Ten"],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "一 (ichi/hito) = One."
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field         | Type    | Notes                                                            |
| ------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`        | string  | `kanji` · `vocabulary` · `grammar` · `reading` · `expression`    |
| `options`     | array   | Exactly 4 choices                                                |
| `answer`      | integer | 0-based index of the correct option                              |
| `reading`     | string  | Optional furigana / reading hint                                 |
| `explanation` | string  | Shown on the results page                                        |

A sample set lives at `public/quizzes/jlpt_n5_kanji_all.json` (110 N5 kanji questions).

## Run in the browser (dev)

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:8080>.

Other handy scripts:

```bash
bun run build        # production build (nitro node-server → .output/)
bun run preview      # serve the production build
bun run lint
bun run format
```

---

## Run as a desktop app (Electron)

The app is wired up as an **Electron** desktop shell. The Electron main process lives at `electron/main.cjs`:

- **In dev**, it loads `http://localhost:8080` (the Vite dev server) — full hot reload.
- **In a packaged build**, it spawns the built Nitro node server (`.output/server/index.mjs`) on a free localhost port and points the window at it. This keeps every route working, including the MCP endpoints.

Quiz history, stats, and streaks live in `localStorage`, which Electron scopes to the app's per-user `userData` directory — so your progress persists across launches and updates automatically.

### Prerequisites

- **Node + Bun** — required for both the web and desktop builds.
- **Linux system libs** — Electron on Pop!_OS / Ubuntu / Debian needs the standard GTK/graphics stack (usually already installed). If Electron fails to launch:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install -y libnss3 libatk-bridge2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libgbm1 libasound2
  ```

### Develop the desktop app

```bash
bun run electron:dev
```

This starts `bun run dev` and, once the dev server responds on port 8080, opens the Electron window pointing at it. Edits hot-reload just like in the browser.

### Build a desktop package (Linux)

```bash
bun run electron:build
```

Output lands in `electron-release/JLPT Practice-linux-x64/`. Launch it directly:

```bash
./electron-release/"JLPT Practice-linux-x64"/"JLPT Practice"
```

Or archive it for sharing / installing on another Pop!_OS machine:

```bash
tar czf JLPT-Practice-linux-x64.tar.gz -C electron-release "JLPT Practice-linux-x64"
```

To install system-wide, drop the folder under `/opt/` and create a `.desktop` launcher pointing at the `JLPT Practice` binary inside it.

### Windows / macOS

The `electron:build` script targets Linux by default. To build for other platforms, run `electron-packager` with a different `--platform` flag on a machine of that OS (Electron cross-compiles from Linux for `win32`/`darwin`, but code-signing and installer creation are host-OS specific):

```bash
bunx electron-packager . "JLPT Practice" --platform=win32 --arch=x64 --out=electron-release --overwrite --prune=true
bunx electron-packager . "JLPT Practice" --platform=darwin --arch=arm64 --out=electron-release --overwrite --prune=true
```

For a proper `.msi` / `.dmg` installer you'll want `electron-builder` on Windows / macOS respectively.

---

## Releases via GitHub Actions (Linux)

`.github/workflows/release.yml` builds a Linux Electron package on GitHub's cloud runners and attaches it to a GitHub Release. Push a `v*` tag to trigger it:

```bash
# bump "version" in package.json
git tag v0.1.1
git push origin v0.1.1
```

The workflow runs on `ubuntu-22.04` (matches Pop!_OS 22.04's glibc), installs deps with `bun install`, runs `bun run build`, then packages with `electron-packager` and uploads a `JLPT-Practice-linux-x64.tar.gz` to the repo's **Releases** page.

No secrets needed — the workflow uses the auto-provisioned `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## Resetting progress

Use **Reset all progress** at the bottom of the Dashboard, or clear Electron's per-app storage:

- Linux: `~/.config/JLPT Practice/`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\JLPT Practice\`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/JLPT Practice/`
